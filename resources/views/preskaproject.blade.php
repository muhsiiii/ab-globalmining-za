                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">ABGM have been closely involved in the Prieska Underground 
									Copper Mine feasibility study for Orion Minerals. The 
									intention is to progress the project to implementation and 
									execution.
									The historical flooded mine shows potential for re-opening 
									and ABGM was asked with the mining engineering and LOM 
									planning of the underground Copper/Zinc reserve.
									The Projectâ€™s base-case underground plan during the 
									Foundation Phase is to de-water and refurbish the shaft, 
									establish new underground infrastructure and start mining 
									the hypogene ore body. The target rate for the underground 
									production of 200ktpm RoM material</p>

                <h5>Challenge</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The ore body is severely un-uniform in terms of geometry 
									and width, therefor making planning of extraction quite 
									challenging as various mining methods require to be 
									designed and scheduled within the mineable reserve with 
									different costs</p>

                <h5>Solution</h5>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">ABGM in conjunction with the Orion mining team developed 
									a detailed and feasible, from a practical and economical 
									point of view, mine design and production schedule.
									The ore body was defined and demarcated/split into four 
									zones and each zone was designed according to its selected 
									mining method. The designs was combined and practically 
									aligned to facilitate production scheduling. The selection of 
									the mining methods was determined by ABGM, based upon 
									the local width and dip of the ore body.
									After several re-iterations a practical and achievable 
									schedule, as per the requirements of the study, was 
									produced which showed positive NPV results.</p>
